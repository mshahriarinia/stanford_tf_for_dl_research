    "__Problem Definition:__  Due to the complexity and dependency on multiple market factors, it is very difficult to predict the dynamic Stock Market performance. But the explosion of market data and market news from multiple sources and the advancement in machine learning (ML) show a great promise to effectively predict its performance. To prove the promise, this study is to predict and validate the returns from 5 stocks (any 5 of your choice).   \n",

    " This is a highly biased sample of the companies. Generally it is recommended that you have a diverse portfolio so that the volatility in your basket is reduced. Unfortunately I am not familiar with companies in other fields such as finance, pharmeceutical, energy, education, etc. Given my very limited knowledge of the stock market I would rather not place bets based on my gut feelings.\n",
